# Event schema

The following files are auto-generated definitions of the event schema. Right now we recommend [reading the high-level SDK development documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/development/sdk-dev/event-payloads/) and only to fall back to those definitions to resolve ambiguities.

In the unlikely event that there are still ambiguities you can also attempt to read [Sentry's source code](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/tree/master/relay-general/src/protocol) from which the following documentation is generated.

- [Download JSON schema](event.schema.json)
- [Download TypeScript definitions](event.schema.ts)

```typescript
{% include "event-schema/event.schema.ts" %}
```
